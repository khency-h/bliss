## Getting Started
Once the website is deployed, you can find it here.

## Future Enhancements

- At the moment, a user does not have the ability to add movies to their own personal list. I would like to add a feature that allows users to do this.
- I would like to add an alert that tells the user they are about to delete something before it gets removed, or allow them to cancel the request.
- I would like to change the design in desktop view, specifically with the header and form pages.
- I would like to implement a feature that allows users to make ratings or comments, and allow them to see other users ratings/comments.
